"This reference manual describes the syntax and \"core semantics\" of the "
"language. It is terse, but attempts to be exact and complete. The "
"semantics of non-essential built-in object types and of the built-in "
"functions and modules are described in :ref:`library-index`. For an "
"informal introduction to the language, see :ref:`tutorial-index`. For C "
"or C++ programmers, two additional manuals exist: :ref:`extending-index` "
"describes the high-level picture of how to write a Python extension "
"module, and the :ref:`c-api-index` describes the interfaces available to "
"C/C++ programmers in detail."
